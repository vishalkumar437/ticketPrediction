## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/railway-ticket-prediction.git
cd railway-ticket-prediction
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary dataset (See [Dataset](#dataset) section).
2. Train and evaluate the models using the provided scripts.
3. Start the Flask app to use the UI for ticket prediction.

## Algorithms Used

This project uses the following machine learning algorithms:

- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- XGBoost
- Naive Bayes

The performance of each algorithm is compared based on their accuracy in predicting ticket confirmation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical railway ticket booking and confirmation data. It includes features like journey date, source, destination, class, etc. Ensure you have the dataset in the `data` directory.

## Model Comparison

To compare the models, execute the `model_comparison.py` script. This will train and evaluate each algorithm, displaying their respective accuracies.

```
python model_comparison.py
```

## UI Using Flask

To run the Flask app for user interaction, execute the following command:

```
python app.py
```

This will start a local server. Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to use the UI for ticket prediction.
